\section*{Preface}

This note is a means of organising my understandings about linear algebra through investigating a few core theorems/topics: the Jordan canonical form, the bilinear form, and then the normal operator. 
This way, you get a deep understanding about the key ideas in transient amplification of neural circuits, such as, positive-definiteness normal matrix.

The note is written in the Q$\&$A fashion, rather than the usual bootstrapping style, therefore requires readers' basic knowledge on linear algebra.
I will use linear algebra terminologies whereas needed without defining it beforehand (though referencing to the formal definition in either the side bar of appendix).
I also add side notes for further explanation whereas necessary. 

All in all, I'll make this private note as readable as possible for the interested. 
Hopefully, readers could enjoy in finding their way to the insights.
